Hi Rally Health,

Here is the task you wanted me to complete after reviewing my application for the Mobile iOS position. 

To the task’s specifications I did not use the native picker view component. Instead I programmatically created a custom class with a UIPickerView variable.

I used Xcode’s storyboard to connect everything.

All requirements were met.

Thank you for your time.

Eric
